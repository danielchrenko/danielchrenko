### Hi there 

👋 My name is Daniel or Danny. I am a Computer science student at the University of Victoria, graduating December 2024. This is where I will keep all of my personal and school projects!

🔭 I am currently trying to learn more about game development!

🏢 Some of my past projects, some of which are on my github, include: various network programming work (simulating http servers + reliable data transfer), raytracing of basic objects (in c++ part of class work), a file system manager (part of operating systems class, used to save and copy data within a disk.IMG file) and more! Trying to compile all of my past work on all devices and upload it all to my github. 

⚡ In my free time I like to play video games, go to the gym and play soccer!

📫 How to reach me: feel free to reach me via LinkedIn
